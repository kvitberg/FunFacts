| Clayton Vila | "I’m not just a skier, that’s not who I’am and whenever I hear someone say; Oh that’s a skier kid or something like that it’s kind of frustrating. I could say it insulting, but if they’re referring to the amount of time I actually ski, then I’m certainly not a skier, more sort of a driver, shoveler, or filmer, editor or all the other parts of the process of the super consuming parts."|
